# A-Story-of-Blocks
The official community project of Block Decentral, a crypto + gaming based discord community. https://discord.gg/Nhp6tXs

We are developing a community game right here, it will be made 100% by us members. Feel free to join the game- making journey. Don't worry if you are not a dev, we are all just starting. We have a group Trello board where our roadmap and stuff is :smile:

If you feel like you cannot code, no matter! We require artists for the 8 bit artwork, we need 8 bit music and ideas to work on, everyone can contribute!

And when the game is finished, everyone who worked on it, even the smallest of efforts will be rewarded with exclusive in- game assets!
And hell, we will reward all the active community members! Just drop by #chat talk with us, drop some ideas, see our progress and give us ideas to work on or create into artwork! :smiley:

And the game we are aiming for is not some ponzi money making scheme, we are aiming for a no money- grab ''Proof of Play''. It means that is won't be pay to win, and every item you earn in-game can be sold and since there will be no loot boxes presale, the demand will be high, expect your efforts to turn into ether :smile:

Everything we do will be decided by you guys, do check #community-poll regularly for that
